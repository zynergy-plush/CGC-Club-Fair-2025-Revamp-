3. Added more designs factors to help with readability and overall impression (like frosted glass effects, etc.)


Recently Fixed🔨:
1. Fixed rendering issues
2. Made background dynamic.
3. Added more information elements.
4. Removed unnecessary content and fixed out-of-place webkit elements.
5. Fixed compatibility issues for all browsers.
6. Fixed spacing issues in gallery.html: It's kind of innovative, since CSS was not really helping, I added a paragraph tag, that has a invisible character in it: ‎  (its not a space, its an actual character). Website I got it from: https://www.editpad.org/tool/invisible-character

Bugs 🐜:
1. Becomes distorted when viewed from different devices/dimensions.
